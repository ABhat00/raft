# raft

the goal for this project is to implement the raft paper (minus snapshotting and log compaction) in such a way that I can easily compile it to WASM and build a web representation 

part of my engineering process is leaving long rambling comments - the notes directory contains some stream of conciousness thoughts about how I'm approaching specific challenges of the implementation. I often change my mind halfway through the document - the entire document is not a source of truth, but the ending should be. Eventually I'll compile all of the notes into a narrative (or maybe index them into a personal LLM)
